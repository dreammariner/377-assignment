We began by setting up a GitHub repository to allow our collaboration to extend beyond in person meet ups, due to conflicting schedules. Once the skeleton of the project was laid out, we split up different areas to research and return with. Dan volunteered to look into implementing our own Bounded Buffer while Michael decided to explore how semaphores are implemented in Java.
